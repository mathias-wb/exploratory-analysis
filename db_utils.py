Here I'm going to perform exploratory data analysis on a loan 
portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation 
techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in 
the loan data.

This information will enable the business to make more informed 
decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

By conducting exploratory data analysis on the loan data, 
I'll aim to gain a deeper understanding of the risk and return 
associated with the business' loans.

Ultimately, my goal is to improve the performance and 
profitability of the loan portfolio,
